# How to use:

for all the steps you need to have python3 installed on your machine

## Try with given sudoku

to try this with the given sudoku all you need to do is run the main.py.


## Try with your own sudoku 

simply put your sudo in .csv format in the sudokus folder and make sure to 
name it sudoku.csv, so the program picks it up


## Speeds:

If the speed in set to 1, the game will render after every single calculation.

This can take quite a while and if you just want to see the solved version
I recommend to just up the speed to the maximum, so it should finish instantly, 
since we only render ones at the start and ones after the sudoku is solved
